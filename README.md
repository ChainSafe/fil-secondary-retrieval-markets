## Secondary Filecoin Retrieval Markets

The aim of this project is to enable secondary retrieval markets in [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/). 

The main feature is an improved discovery mechanism that allows anyone who is willing to provide data to listen for and respond to requests for data. These parties are not necessarily incentivized to store this data through the core Filecoin protocol, and therefore this creates a secondary market that can reduce reliance on miners and allow the network to scale.

❗**Current development should be considered a work in progress.**
